InCheck-Client
===============

Client of my InCheck project

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1) Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2) Install all requirements automatically with `npm install`
3) Run the server with `node index.js`. By default it will run on Port 5000, which can be changed through the `process.env.PORT` variable.

This requires an instance of [InCheck-Server](https://github.com/ToTheFarWest/InCheck-Server), the location of which can be configured through [service.js](./service.js)
